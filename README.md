Player 1 starts first.

Player 1 can type any number between 1 to 6 to place your piece which is 'o' on the game board.

For instance, if the Player 1 type `1` and hit `enter` key, the board will be updated such as below.

Now, Player 2's turn. 

The game ends when one of them lines up four pieces in a row or both doesn't line up four pieces until the end which leads to a tie game.
